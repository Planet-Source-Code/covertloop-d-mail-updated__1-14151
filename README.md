### Description

UPDATED WITH .BAS FILES INCLUDED

'D-Mail' uses tcp/ip to send mail between the sender and recipient. It has a nice interface and some good features in mind. You cannot send/receive 'E-Mail', nor can you Attach files with this application as of yet. But you can send mail with another user of this application. PSC would not allow me to upload a 608kb project for some annoying reason, so I uploaded it to another site at:
